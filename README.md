## Overview

Apartments is my first complete application written in **Node.js/Express** using EJS as template engine and **MongoDB** as database. It follows the MVC design pattern and it works with two different viewss:

#### Customer

The user can search for a suitable apartment introducing reservation dates, province, city, maximun occupancy and price interval. Can also make a reservation that is stored in the database.

#### Administrator

The user can manage all the apartment properties (CRUD): create new apartments, modify, list and delete them.

#### A word of caution

Some functionalities are still not implemented, especially those ones related with the full deployment of the application.
